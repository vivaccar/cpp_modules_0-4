# C++ Modules Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you will find my progress and exercises completed in the C++ modules at 42. Each module builds upon the previous ones, introducing essential concepts in C++ programming. Below is a brief overview of each module:

## Module 00: Foundations of C++

In this module, I learned the fundamentals of C++ programming, including:
- **Classes**: Understanding how to define and use classes.
- **Namespaces**: Learning about the importance of namespaces to avoid name collisions.
- **Member Functions**: Implementing functions that belong to a class.
- **Access Modifiers**: Exploring public and private attributes.

## Module 01: Memory Management

This module focused on memory management in C++, covering:
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `new` and `delete` to manage memory.
- **Pointers**: Understanding pointer arithmetic and usage.
- **References**: Utilizing references for efficient function parameters.
- **Switch Statements**: Implementing switch-case structures for control flow.

## Module 02: Advanced Class Features

In Module 02, I learned about advanced class features:
- **Ad-hoc Polymorphism**: Using function overloading to achieve polymorphism.
- **Operator Overloading**: Customizing the behavior of operators for user-defined types.
- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: Understanding the importance of constructors, destructors, and copy constructors.
- **Fixed-point Numbers**: Implementing a fixed-point number class for precise calculations.

## Module 03: Inheritance and Polymorphism

Module 03 introduced inheritance and polymorphism concepts:
- **Inheritance**: Creating derived classes that inherit from base classes (e.g., `Cat` inherits from `Animal`).
- **Subtype Polymorphism**: Understanding how to use derived classes interchangeably with base classes.
- **Code Example**: Implementing a simple hierarchy of classes to demonstrate inheritance.

## Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces

In this module, I explored:
- **Abstract Classes**: Learning how to create classes that cannot be instantiated.
- **Interfaces**: Implementing pure virtual functions to define interfaces.
- **Polymorphism in Action**: Building a polymorphic class hierarchy with `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat`.
- **Practical Examples**: Implementing classes that demonstrate these concepts in action.
